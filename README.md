# Marqet
Parse a .csv file and locate occurence of words (to help identify target markets)
This is originally written for a DiscoverOrg list in which any individual cell will have multiple values seperated by a ','

- Prompt user to enter & subsequently open a .csv file
- Scan .csv file to search for column titles
  - Prompt user which column title they would like to scan for frequency, or enter 'all' to scan all column titles
    except company name
  - Print top 10 to console, and prompt user if they would like to print full list & stats to an output .txt file.
  
# PLANNED FUTURE UPDATES #
- Allow users to create a 'list' of words that they would like to compare to
  - "rank" potential opps by number of matching words
